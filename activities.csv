You have a great life in front of you, but your great life is in front of you. It's not behind you. Everything you're going through is preparing you for what you ask God for. You just got to quit tripping while you in the process.

Because the process is necessary. You may not see it now, but when he gets you on the other side of it, you're going to see exactly why it went that way and you're going to be okay with it. Pull yourself together and quit tripping cause you in the process.
God is processing you. He ain't through with you. If he was through with you, you would not wake up in the morning. When you feel like giving up, don't when you thinking about giving up, don't when it look like you ain't going to make it. Keep going when they tell you you can't.

Come on, man. Who are they? When they tell you to put all your stuff back on your desk. Don't do that, man. Don't do that when they tell you you're not going to make it. Don't believe a man. Don't believe them. You got to be relentless. And I'm saying to you, what if all of us took that attitude after we face a rejection and a no?
Or we have a meeting and no one shows up? Or some body say, you can count on me, and they don't come through? Nobody believes in you. You've lost again and again and again. The lights are cut off, but you're still looking at your dreams. Reviewing it every day and say to yourself, it's not over until I win.

The harder the battle, the sweeter the victory. See, what you become in the process is more important than the dream. That's far more important. The kind of person you become, the character that you build, the courage that you develop, the faith that you're manifesting, oh, it's it's something that you get up in the morning, you look yourself in the mirror.

You're a different kind of person. You walk with a different kind of spirit. And people know, if you know what life is, that you have embraced life. You knew it was hard, but you did it harder."" - Steve Harvey ",3023,0,161.0,32,false,,,activities/10552983706.fit.gz,,,3023.0,3023.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,95.0,,146.52365112304688,,,513.0,,,32.0,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,""
